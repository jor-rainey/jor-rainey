## Profile
Graduated from Swansea University with a degree in Civil Engineering. Spent 9 years working as an Engineer involved in asset management of road bridges. I became more exposed to, and interested in, the potential of increased data usage throughout the business. I subsequently sought more data based projects professionally and am looking to pivot my career to a Data Analyst role. I use this space to showcase projects that I've completed as I learn more skills and tools to play with data.
